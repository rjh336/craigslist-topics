      "so how does music production work?  what does a music producer do?  why does every music artist go to a music producer? did you know that every single song that you have ever heard on the radio or on your favorite albums was made by a music producer? all your favorite songs were made by a music producer working together with an artist, band, or songwriter.  so why is a music producer always the next step in any legitimate artists's career, and what can a music producer do for me?\n",
      "\n",
      "here's how it works.  you are an aspiring singer , songwriter, or band.  you have an idea for a song and want to make it into a radio quality, release ready, \"finished\" song. a producer can take your idea for a song and he creates all the music for it, he works together with you on the different parts of your song, he records you singing your lyrics, and then he edits it all. as an artist, singer, rapper, vocalist or band,  you need a talented producer that can take your song ideas to the next level and get your songs turned into an album or into singles that are recorded and finished at a level of industry-standard quality. a producer can take as little as your vocal melody, your lyrics, your piano chords/ ideas, or your partially written songs. . ..and he will help carry them to the finish line and turn them into radio ready songs.  here at platinum waves, you can tell us your favorite song by your favorite artists and then tell us the sound that you are hoping to achieve with your song. we will listen to and study your favorite songs by your favorite artists, and we will custom create your songs using the same type of feel, elements, instruments and sound that you are going for-- all with the same type of sounds and feel that you like in your favorite songs. we can model your song idea after any specific sound or other song by another artist that you love the feel of, and that you love singing to or already know that you sound great singing to. this is the same way that all of your favorite artists came to eventually find and link up with a great music producer that took their songs to the next level. whether it was producers like dr. luke first working with avril lavinge and doing her songs, timberland doing nelly furado's songs back in the day, markus dravs first working on coldplay's album-- when they had never recorded in pro tools yet and had no idea what wonders it would change for their sound and how the decision to work with him would define their band's sound. or even when lady gaga got \"red-one\" to do her song \"just dance\" for her. the list goes on and on down the line for every single artist and band that you can think of all made the next step and found a producer. and that is how music production works.  \n",
      "\n",
      " we will create a totally new song for you or produce your existing song idea or chords into a fully done song for you to write your lyrics to. then we will record your vocals , edit them, and give you back your own, finished, fully produced, release-ready song.  by using the same types of instruments and style to create your song, you are free as the artist to write your own lyrics and vocal melodies to something that you know you already like and works well with your voice because you told us exactly what you wanted in your song and what you wanted it to sound like. if you already have you chords and vocal melodies written first, we will use them to build the entire song around your ideas. we will use all the production tricks and techniques that are in your favorite songs. -------we work royalty free, so no matter how much we contribute to your song during the production process, the song still belongs 100% to you. ----------some producers take as much as 75% equity of your song. we take zero. we relinquish all right to you, the artist.  the way that we work is on a flat rate, per-song basis. we charge you one flat rate per song. the flat rates vary per song, depending on the genre and number of songs that you are wanting to complete. so please call for a free consultation. the flat rate per song fee will include all production, programming of all synths, song elements, all drums, all recording, all editing of everything from timing, pitch, phase issues, fixing dynamics issues, equalization, frequency manipulation, sound design compression, help with any writing if needed, recording of vocals, editing all vocals, cool production tricks,  mixing and mastering.  we do all styles and sounds from pop, r&b, rock, country, indie, alternative, edm, americana, folk, and bands. so if you are a band also looking to turn your live songs into professionally recorded, fully produced songs, we can help. so take that next step with your music. it's time for you to have your own songs and work with a producer that can help you take your song ideas the way that you envision them in your head, and make them a reality. the job of any great producer is to help you make your vision for your music into release-ready, industry standard songs. we work in pro tools, using the newest production techniques for a modern industry standard sound. call today.  \n",
      "\n",
      "also, remember that there is a huge difference between \"recording\" and \"producing\". anyone that can press a record button can \"record\", but not everyone can \"produce\" your songs to sound like \"radio quality hits\".  always be sure to listen to people's samples of their quality, production ability, and songwriting abilities before choosing to work with them. listen to a studio's examples to make sure they actually can give you that modern day edge and professional sound that you are looking for. there are tons of guys that record, but their methods are way outdated, and don't sound modern anymore. maybe their sound was new back in the 80's, but this is now, and you want your sound to sound new and not like it was recorded 30 years ago.   \n",
      "once you realize that there are only a few producers or studios that can actually deliver what you need, then your decision will be much easier and you will save your songs and music from disaster. we use only top of the line production gear. we use pro tools 10 hd.  we know and understand pro tools, melodyne, and modern music production techniques like it's second nature. we use only the same gear, software and techniques that are used to make the professional albums that you hear on the radio today. we can produce all genres including top 40 pop style , rock music, folk rock ( coldplay, u2,the fray) , hip hop, r&b, rap, contemporary, country, acoustic, electronic, indie, classical. so, whether you are looking for your own original new sound or even if your style is an older style like classic rock ( led zeppelin, steve miller, the who) or an older hip hop sound, we can breath new life into you songs and record / produce them at new modern quality standard and make you sound better than those original artists themselves. please check out the link below to the website so that you can get more info or listen to a couple songs samples etc, then call and leave a message with your name and number and we will get back to you right away.\n",

      " Anyone with a similar passion? \n",
      "i'm looking to find some people to start a project/band/culture with. i always wanted to have a band that started as high school buddies, however none of my close friends were into making music, so i never really had a chance to reach out to others. now life has taken over that dream; i'm 30, have a career, married and have kids so that should give you an idea of what comes first in my life. however, i'm still very passionate about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "i have been disenchanted with most music available today, and if there is good music it's not getting heard, or overplayed on the radio. i want to make a more original variety of music than the popular trends today. there's a lot of talented people out there that are overshadowed by bigger names and wallets. it's hard to get anywhere by yourself so i'd like to get together with some people who are looking for something similar, whether you have a few pieces together already or not. all i really care is that you possess something unique and have a passion to pursue success. \n",
      "\n",
      "i want to start a project/collaboration that is constantly changing, developing and entertaining in different ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "for now, i'm just seeing if there are people out here like me, trying to find the right opportunity or people to surround themselves with. i'm not into defining what style i associate with because there are so many different genres out there and i would never want to be restricted in a compartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "my random music library may include: coldplay, breaking benjamin, iron and wine, muse, mumford and sons, rob thomas, jason mraz, matt nathanson, john mayer, josh groban, phil collins, the beatles, justin timberlake, linkin park, michael buble, blink 182, blue october, fun, goldfinger, mika, hoobastank, tenacious d, sia, owl city, the postal service, riddlin' kids, oldies to new music, even disney or broadway songs. all of which are artists or bands who have inspired me at one point in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "really anything that has emotional lyrics or passion in the music, not just a catchy phrase or lick repeated over and over. i don't like the whole 80's classic rock thing, or such hardcore metal that words aren't even important. i don't mind covering music, but that's not all i want to do. i want to be better than that, not just recognized because i follow in line with styles, but create and love whatever we form. musicians aren't popular for following others, but because they are uniquely themselves and love being themselves. if i can find some people that aren't just great with their talent, but also great at loving their talent, i'd be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "i want to be refreshingly different. the music industry right now is talented, but nobody is really standing out. i want to throw in random instruments and unique sounds in every song to give variety and change between tracks! i get sick of bands quick because i feel like each song sounds the same. i envision a live show where multiple people take turns singing and rotating different instruments, or at least be open to creativity. the shows wouldn't be a few people standing around, but actually have choreography and be able to entertain an audience; timed fireworks, video effects and stunts; basically, putting on a literal show like the word used to mean. i want to get lost in the moment on stage, that's what i crave.\n",
      "\n",
      "i am nowhere near flawless, but i feel like i have the creativity and passion to perfect what i bring to the table. i self taught myself to dabble on the guitar, piano, and other instruments. i really enjoy singing. i'm also very creative. as a video editor i enjoy visual entertainment as well with visual effects on stage or awesome music videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you had the time, the money or the team to create music today, would it be a success? be honest with yourself when responding to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "i feel like if i auditioned for the voice, i could compete. but my creativity and passion i believe sets me apart. and that's what i'm looking for. people that know themselves and know they have something. not just someone who can play the part. it's a very tough industry. you have to stand out just to get your foot in the door. that's why i'm looking to build something with the right people who want to put in the work, and work together. \n",
      "\n",
      "so yes, i am very set on what i'm looking for, but at the same time very open to what it might be. if you're on here, calling yourself a pro singer or band with tons of exposure and experience, that's not a good sign because that means you've done all that, and still haven't made it past craigslist. i often listen to their music and it's dreadful. i'd rather meet someone that is simply undiscovered or just finished music school, or great reviews on a youtube video and want to start the next chapter of their career. if you feel the same way, please reach out to me. when you email me, make sure to include some audio attachments or youtube links that i can check out. if you don't even have that, it will be difficult to believe you have a passion for making music (even if it's old stuff like mine is).\n",
      "\n",
      "let me know why you're interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "and thank you for taking the time to read this. it's amazing how many people can't even handle that. i can tell those who have really listened, verses those that just send what they've forwarded everyone else. \n",
      "\n",

      "first of all, my name is taylor. i'm a 25 year old bass player, writing this ad on behalf of my brother and i. my brother is a 24 year old musical genius, i suppose you could say. but for this group, he is planning to play rhythm guitar. he can play lead if need be, and he is an incredible drummer. but he'd prefer to stick to rhythm guitar. if you can play guitar, and sing, that's a major plus. him and i have been performing in bands together for years, we have toured the country, been managed professionally, and played alongside national acts. so bottom line, we've done the whole garage band thing, battle of the bands crap, and we're not looking to do that. my brother has been working on an ep for over a year. it's currently being recorded by one of our good friends, whom is also a music producer out in d.c. once all of the tracks are finished, we will need vocals put onto them. we're looking for a singer, who's voice matches the genre pretty well. of course that all comes down to personal opinion, but if you think you have a good pop punk voice, you probably know what we're looking for. after we get vocals on the tracks, we're immediately going to send them to labels, and promoters.\n",
      "\n",
      "our plan is not to \"jam\" or any of that to see if we mesh right away. what we'd like, is for you to send a recording of yourself singing, with or without music, it doesn't matter. if we like your voice, i will set up a meeting between us, so we can meet face to face, and make sure we get along well in case we start touring/playing shows. you have to like the guys you tour with, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "we have a band name, and a track available for us to send to you. i will not release the track or band name publicly on here. once we hear your voice, if we like what we hear, you will get all the details you need. so yes, this is a brand new band, with nothing put out on itunes, youtube, or spotify yet. we're planning to perfect everything, and make an explosive entry into the local music scene. we want people to wonder who the hell we are, and where we came from when we start playing our first shows. ideally, a label will pick us up, and throw us on tour immediately with a national act, but that's a long shot. it has happened in the past, but it's rare. labels do love a fresh money making cow though, that's for sure. we think this band will be very sellable. \n",
      "\n",
      "things we'd like from you!! \n",
      "\n",
      "this is a band, so please try your best to look the part. unfortunately good music isn't all that sells anymore, we need to be sellable as members. \n",
      "\n",
      "if you have your own pa system, that is a major plus! we don't own one, and if you don't, it's not a big deal. i'd be fine with all of us throwing down some money for a pa. once the ball gets rolling, we will begin regular practices, and need a pa for that. i want to be able to hear you sing. as for a practice space, we don't have one rented yet. i know of a few places in minneapolis i used to rehearse at, which we can each split 4-5 ways, depending on how many members we will end up having (my guess is 5, but i could be wrong.) if you have a spot to rehearse, even better. as long as we can be loud! \n",
      "\n",
      "we do not want any pretentious douche bags, that think they're already famous, and a gift to the world. i've worked with several people like that, and i can promise you that everyone in the music scene wants to kick people like that in the head. don't be a dick, be humble, and enjoy having fun. \n",
      "\n",
      "harmonies harmonies harmonies!! please be able to do harmonies without the aid of my brother and i. clearly we work as a team, and i'm sure we're going to have group vocals in songs, but please be able to harmonize! \n",
      "\n",
      "a major thing we're looking for is someone with a devotion to music. i work full time, and my brother is a student at the u. so we are not asking you to quit your job, or anything like that. but if we were offered a touring slot with a bigger band, we'd say yes immediately, and expect the same from you. \n",
      "\n",
      "please do not be addicted to drugs. partying is fun, we get it, and we're all for it. i am a recovering alcoholic/cocaine addict myself, and take it very seriously. i have no problems with people drinking or partying around me at all (i mean, we can't lol, we're musicans for fuck sake) so if you like to drink, smoke weed, or whatever, we're all for it! as long as you are not dependent on drugs like i was alcohol/cocaine. and when it comes to practices/shows, please show up sober. save the partying for after practice/shows. \n",
      "\n",
      "you must have a chill/good sense of humor, and an open mind as a whole. my brother and i make a lot of gay/sexual jokes with each other. we're looking for someone that shares that same sense of humor. we are big allies to the lgbt community, so you must be okay around gay/transgender people. one of my lifelong goals is to perform at minnesota's gay pride festival. my brother and i are straight white guys, very accepting of other people's beliefs, and different walks of life. this includes race, sexual orientation, gender idtentity, and religion. we're atheists, but completely respect other people's faith, as long as we are not pressured to convert. if you have jesus in your heart, that's great, we couldn't be happier for you! but leave it outside of the band please.\n",
      "\n",
      "we swear.... a lot. we are not asking you to swear lol, but we say fuck a lot. that's just how we speak to one another. so please be okay with foul language. \n",
      "\n",
      "overall, we just want to have fun. we'd also like to have \"joke\" songs, or whatever you wanna call them. such as blink-182's family reunion. we want to make people laugh, and never forget us. doing funny photo shoots, goofy music videos, stuff like that. if we're having fun, our listeners will too.\n",
      "\n",
      "we're getting to the end of this long ass ad, and i want to thank you for taking the time to read it. if you choose to reply, please send an email telling us a bit about yourself, what makes you stand out, a selfie would be cool, and if you'd like to get right to it, send me a track, or clip of you singing. when it comes to your age, we're pretty relaxed about that. i found my first serious band when i was 16 on craigslist. preferably, you be at least 18, but if you're like i was at 16, we can make exceptions. once we get the ball rolling, and these tracks recorded, we will work together as a team of 3 to find the remaining members of this band. once we have everyone, we will begin regular rehearsals, get photo shoots done, get merch, and take the bull by the horns. let's change the world guys, pop punk is not dead! \n",

      "\n",
      "my main problem is, i live in minneapolis. there is no one around here that is looking for the same kind of thing that i am. so, i'm looking further, to see if i can find those right people else where. here's how i'm proposing going about this (which i understand might go differently when actually put into action):\n",

      "i just wanted to post here just to simply get out of my own head regarding music and try my best to learn and share music with other like-minded people. i've been wanting to create my own sound for awhile with a group, and i'm just now getting the courage to do so. i'm an 18 year old college student, with not much experience when it comes to playing live, and some basic level guitar and piano skill. i like to think there's not much i know for either instrument, but there's nothing i can't learn. i can sit down, review a few chords, and learn a song no problem with a bit of practice. \n",
      "\n",
      "i'm simply looking to get with a group, take some encouragement, dedication, a wanting to create good music and just learn along the way. it's much better than me sitting at home, writing songs, trying to get a certain sound on my own and somewhat failing, not that i don't enjoy that, i just want \"more.\" i would be interested in joining a band, but it will take me awhile to learn any songs you have written. \n",
      "\n",
      "i enjoy artists like john mayer, grouplove, foster the people, young the giant, the 1975, mumford, coldplay, bon iver, the list goes on and on. and i'd like to stay in that genre. i don't have much interest in playing and singing music of the past, or covering anything as a regular practice. i'd like to create unique, real, indie sounds. i'm dedicated to creating music and want to make music for people, i love listening to it, but it almost gets tiring, i want to create it.  \n",

      "i've got a project i've been working on for a little over a year now. i've written and recorded 16 or so complete songs. guitars, drums, bass, everything. i had a vocalist of an old band that i've been trying to record vocals for this project, but our schedules just never seem to line up. so i figured i'd look online for maybe someone else that could fill the role.\n",
      "\n",
      "this project is rather varied, but it's rock music through and through. it's been heavily influenced by bands like thrice. so if you're a fan of thrice, keep reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "a little bit about me, i'm 34, i'm married with 2 little kids. i also have one of those career type jobs. so i'm not looking to tour or anything of that sort. i've been playing guitar & bass for 20 years. i've played in every kind of band you can imagine. but i've never recorded an entire album doing all of the instrumentation myself. and that's all this is really. i can sing, and i've thought of doing all the vocals too. but after recording a few of these songs, i began to want to make these songs as good as they can be. so that's where you come in. i need an amazing rock singer.\n",
      "\n",
      "what i'd ideally like to do is send you a track and have you do your own recording at your home. send it to me for mixing, i send back with changes. so on and so forth until we have a completed album. my life is too busy to have \"recording sessions\" at my house where screaming kids are on the other side of the wall. \n",
      "\n",
      "what i'm looking for is someone that understands that this is just a project. there is no band. it's just me. i need someone that can record on their own. someone that understands a song will need many different tracks of vocals, not just one track soaked in reverb. therefore, someone that can harmonize with themselves. someone that can take constructive criticism if i send a track back to have parts re-sang. and lastly, i don't need cookie monster. i can do all the backing screams we need. i was a screamer in a lot of bands. i also don't need lyrics and song titles to be about sacrificing a first born, hail satan, and so forth. i am a christian, although you don't need to be. i just want clean lyrics that i could play for my kids. that make sense?\n",
      "\n",
      "so, if you're interested in hearing a track, head to https://soundcloud.com/werewolvesmusic to listen to one of my completed songs. if you dig it, and you want to try to record some vocals over it, just respond to the ad and i can email it to you. let me know what you've got, and if it works, then we'll get this thing going. \n",

      "\n",
      "and, working with you, your singing, in the studio -- i'm a very attentive, sensitive \"sounding board\" for you, helping you get the best vocal performance you're capable of...  letting you know when you've really got a great take -- or if you should try re-singing a verse or a single phrase to get a better sound or a better interpretation of the line.  my previous clients will tell you that i helped them get vocal performances in the studio that were far better than they thought they were capable of! -- and which really made the song, and the album, more special, more exciting.\n",

(the accordion belongs to the band, but our current keys player has a keyboard for the other sounds)  be open to input from the band and give input to the band on the music we are making.  again, all the money made by the band goes back into the band, so don't expect to make a living right away off this... but do expect to eventually make a living doing this.  take the band and music seriously, but never take yourself too seriously.\n",

      "just the other day i was told by someone who owned a wine bar that they really liked our music and would love for us to play at their place. she then told me the gig paid $75 for a trio. now $75 used to be bad money per person, let alone $75 for the whole band. it had to be a joke, right? no, she was serious. but it didn't end there. she then informed us we had to bring 25 people minimum. didn't even offer us extra money if we brought 25 people. i would have laughed other than it's not the first time i've gotten this proposal from club owners. but are there musicians really doing this? yes. they are so desperate to play, they will do anything. but let's think about this for a second and turn this around a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "what if i told the wine bar owner that i have a great band and we are going to play at my house. i need someone to provide and pour wine while we play. i can't pay much, just $75, and you must bring at least 25 people who are willing to pay a $10 cover charge at the door. now wouldn't they look at you like you are crazy?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why would i do that?\" they would ask. well because it's great exposure for you and your wine bar. the people there would see how well you pour wine and see how good your wine is. then they would come out to your wine bar sometime.  \"but i brought all the people myself, i already know them\", they would say. well maybe you could make up some professional looking flyers, pass them out, and get people you don't know to come on out. \"but you are only paying me $75. how can i afford to make up flyers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "you see how absurd this sounds, but musicians do this all the time. if they didn't, then the club owners wouldn't even think of asking us to do it. so this sounds like a great deal for the club owners, doesn't it?  they get a band and customers for that night, and have to pay very little if anything. but what they don'trealize is that this is not in their best interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "     if you want great food, you hire a great chef. . .it needs to be the same with the band. you hire a great band and should expect great music.\n",
      "\n",
      "running a restaurant, a club, a bar, is really hard. there is a lot at stake for the owner. you are trying to get loyal customers that will return because you are offering them something special. if you want great food, you hire a great chef. if you want great decor,you hire a great interior decorator. you expect these professionals to do their best at what you are hiring them to do. it needs to be the same with the band. you hire a great band and should expect great music. that should be the end of your expectations for the musicians. the music is another product for the venue to offer, no different from food or beverages.\n",
      "\n",
      "when a venue opens it's doors, it has to market itself. the club owner can't expect people to just walk in the door. this has to be handled in a professional way. do you really want to leave something so important up to a musician? this is where the club owner needs to take over. it is their success or their failure on the line, not the musician. the musician can just move on to another venue. i've played places where, for whatever reason, only a few people have walked in the door on a saturday night. the club owner got mad at me, asking, \"where are the people?\" i turned it around on him asking the same thing? \"where are all the people? it's saturday night and your venue is empty. doesn't that concern you? what are you going to do about it?\"  usually their answer is to find another band with a larger following.this means the professional bands get run out of the joint in favor of whoever can bring in the most people.\n",
      "\n",
      "    but here's where the club owner doesn't get it. the crowd is following the band, not the venue. the next night you will have to start all over again.\n",

      "eddie mechanic, who has slaved all week fixing cars at the local dealership, also plays guitar. not very well,but he's been practicing once a week with doctor drummer, banker bass player, and salesman singer. usually they just drink beer between rehearsing a few tunes in eddie's garage, but this week they answer a craigslist ad and line up a big gig. well they don't sound that good, but they sure all work with a lot of people everyday. all these people can be given a flyeron monday and after being asked \"are you coming to my gig?\" everyday all week, will most likely show up on saturday night. so mission accomplished, the club owner has packed his venue for one night.\n",
      "\n",
      "but here's where the club owner doesn't get it. the crowd is following the band, not the venue. the next night you will have to start all over again. and the people that were starting to follow your venue, are now turned off because you just made them listen to a bad band. the goal should be to build a fan base for the venue. to get people that will trust that you will have good music in there every night. instead you've soiled your reputation for a quick fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think we as musicians need to fight back. sure you can get mad about it, but that won't do anything.we could all agree not to play those for the door gigs, but you know that isn't going to happen. but what we can do, is explain to the club owner that it's not in their best interest to operate their business like this. there is too much at stake for them not to be truly interested in the music presented in their venue. convince them that if they think that live music is important to the demographic that they are trying to reach, then they need to reach out to that demographic in a professional way. [read \"how to negotiate with a venue that says they can't pay you\"]\n",
      "if you asked a club owner, \"who is your target demographic?\"  i doubt they would answer, \"the band's friends and family.\"  but yet clubs operate like it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "    would you expect the chef's friends and family to eat at your restaurant every night? how about the dishwasher, the waitresses, the hostess? you see, when you start turning this argument around, it becomes silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "another example, i answered a craigslist ad for a nice looking place in beverly hills. the ad read. . . \"looking for a high energy jazz band, if you can bring the band and have a following, i will put you on stage.\" that logic seams to say that they think musicians in a jazz band know lots of people living in beverly hills. and the people those musicians know, have lots of money to spend. those are two pretty big assumptions. good luck finding the combination. even if you find that combination, are you going to find it every night?  friends and family of a professional musician won't come out that often. they can't. this is what we do every night. would you expect the chef's friends and family to eat at your restaurant every night? how about the dishwasher, the waitresses, the hostess? or how about the club owners friends and family? you see, when you start turning this argument around, it becomes silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've started arguing with club owners about this. it happened after i played a great night of music in la. we were playing for a % of the bar. there were about50 people there in this small venue, so it was a good turnout. at the end of the night, i go to get paid, and hope to book another gig. the club owner was angry.  \"where are your people?\" he asked.  \"all these people, i brought in. we had a speed dating event  and they are all left over from that.\"  i pointed out they all stayed and listened to the music for 2 hours after their event ended. that was 2 more hours of bar sales, because without us, you have an empty room with nothing going on. he just couldn't get over the fact that we didn't walk in with our own entourage of fans. wasn't he happy that we kept a full room spending money? right when we were talking, a group of people interrupted us and said \"you guys sound  great, when is the next time you're playing here again?\" the club owner, said \"they aren't, they didn't  bring anyone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i went home that night bummed out and sent him an email telling him most of what you are reading here and how his business model and thinking is flawed. after a lot of swearing back and forth, because i'm guessing that musicians never talk to him as a business equal. he eventually admitted that what i was saying made sense. but, that's not how la clubs and restaurants work. and he has bands answering his craigslist ads willing to do whatever it takes to get the gig. it's been a couple of years now since that conversation. i called his bar, and the number is disconnected.\n",
      "\n",
      "so there you go, la club and restaurant owners.the advice is free. but you'll most likely ignore it because \"that's not how it works\". but if more musicians kept telling them the same thing, perhaps it would start to sink in.\n",

      "hello, i'm looking to start an experimental band. primarily electronic music influenced but with a good chunk of guitar work and rock influence. also no super long songs or anything. i play guitar, synth, bass, write songs, and vox. i want to just work on the instrumentation for awhile then start working on integrating the lyrics and all (i have lyrics ready just don't know where to put them or how the group will sound). if my voice doesn't work with what happens i am open to finding a new vocalist, but for now i wanna start with me. i am really open minded musically and am more influenced by electronic music and hip hop then rock currently. i would prefer multi instrumentalists but that's not a deal breaker if we click. i've been formulating ideas for this project for like over a year. would prefer a drummer that knows how to use drum machines also but not a deal breaker. and they are easy to learn. i know im being vague but i really want to create something visceral, emotional, and unique. i feel that is more important for me to say then oh i wanna sound like whatever, because im sure the sound will evolve in different ways depending on the people im around. i really love glitched out anolouge synth sounds (i like digital too of course) and want to be able to do most of the synth stuff live with hardware synths. also really starting to get into sampling. im a 20 y/o college student, and practices at least once a week are a must, because this isn't going to be an easy project. i live in an apt so i can't provide practice space. thanks for reading. \n",

      "\"i picked up a banjo for the first time thirty-two years ago and played for just a short time. personal circumstances happened, and the banjo got sold. in february , i came across a fantastic deal on a deering sierra banjo, i bought the banjo and the earl scruggs book and tried to take off. but seriously, learning to play the banjo by merely reading a book, as good as the book may be, is like trying to learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book on bicycle riding. while i was getting the basic role patterns down, and understanding some of the basic banjo lick moves, each step forward created many problems that i just couldn't make sense of. i am a visual learner, and i needed to see the things i needed to do. i came across a student who was taking lessons online through a web cam. being a techno lover, i was intrigued. i contacted the student's teacher, from the moment allen answered the phone, i knew this was going to be a good match. he is the quintessential people person. i don't believe he's ever met a stranger. we talked about my age (58), my previous banjo experience, and what i was trying to do. from our conversation it seemed that a \"distance learning\" situation would be perfect. i could take banjo lessons and not have to leave the comfort of my home. \"as of this writing, i have been meeting with al online every week via web cam. by my third lesson, i was playing foggy mountain breakdown. \"now i must say, al is no slouch. he's as tough a teacher over the internet as if he were in the same room. he also has an ear that drives me crazy. if my 3-2 push offs are sloppy, he lets me know it quickly. he guides me through each lesson as a good coach. playing, showing, cajoling, encouraging me all the way. \"i live in lexington, kentucky. the home of j. d. crowe. i live in the heart of the bluegrass where banjos and banjo teachers are plentiful. but i believe i could not be learning any faster, better, or more effectively than with al. i highly recommend that if you're interested in a banjo teacher--and if you're serious about the banjo you should be serious about a teacher--you'll find no one better. - craig l, ph.d. - lexington, kentucky\n",

'stars' or wanabee stars w/backing bands need not apply. solo acts disguised as 'bands' will probably not get a response from me either, please don't waste my time. if the band is named after you, check out the many pro drummers for hire here on cl. not looking for a co-op situation or any situation in which a drummer is only needed to 'play out' drum parts that has already been written (essentially a 'hired gun' for free). again, nothing wrong with an artist wanting a backing band to support them, just don't contact me, thanks.\n",

      "after years of listening to and breaking down the songs of my favorite rock and pop artists of the 60s through today, i have heard a lot of similarities in terms of what moves a listener. from writing a verse that's melodically engaging enough to make the listener want more to getting that chorus to jump right out at them once they've made it that far. from telling enough of the story in the first verse to having that first chorus tie it all together. from doing stream of consciousness writing to doing lyrical rewrites. when to trust your intuition, when to work things out on your instrument, when to take a walk and work things out in your head. when to focus more on rhythm, when to focus more on pitch, when to focus more on melodic direction, when to focus more on form. i can show you how to analyze your favorite songs in a fun and rewarding way using what i call \"musical maps\"- breaking down the basic elements of each part of a song and how they flow into one another. i can show you how to build a song around any idea and how to marry lyrics and music that may fit mood-wise but seem totally different in terms of rhythm and syllables.  if you're unfamiliar with musical theory as it applies to your instrument, i can show you fun ways to better navigate your instrument and use the information today without having to drop everything and study advanced harmony (although i would never discourage studying harmony- just don't drop everything!). i can show you how you can be constantly writing while away from your instrument, and not just lyrics. i can show you how to get more out of your collaborations, because sometimes there is nothing better than bouncing ideas off of someone that you respect, that is honest, and that shares your music values. if you're curious, reach out to me and let me know what your goals are. i'll let you know right off the bat if i think i can help you, you can share some of your music, i can share mine, and we can set up an appointment. i have an exhaustive list of methods and directions to go in so you never have to suffer from writer's block, from not knowing how to improve a song you're working on and/or from not knowing how to say what it is you want to say. cheers! \n",

      "whether or not you have professional aspirations, singing, like everything, is more fun when you do it well. i remember feeling so frustrated because i had two thoughts almost every time i sang: i hate my sound and it hurts to sing. like so many singers i had a burning desire to get my creative heart and soul out there through my voice. i took lots of lessons with lots of teachers (including speech level), practiced like mad, read everything i could about how the voice works, and eventually discovered the voice i love. it sounds good and feels good to sing. i've been singing professionally for over 30 years so getting it together was pretty important. but even a recreational singer should experience the pleasure of singing with a free and relaxed voice. i'd like to share what i have learned with you. i recently read that the best teachers are the ones who have had to overcome their own difficulties. often great singers don't know how they got to be so good. in any case, you want singing to be effortless and fun. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in addition to freeing the voice, there are many other things to learn about singing that expand the experience to a more fulfilling level. how about musicianship, for instance? that is, learning the language of music so that you can communicate with instrumentalists, write your own charts, compose your own songs. taking the guesswork out of fundamentals and theory opens many doors and allows you to ask for what you want in a way that other musicians can understand. it also contributes to that all important confidence level that enhances your performing life. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "finally, one of the most important questions any singer must ask is: what do i want to sing? there are so many styles, so many songs. most singers want to find the voice that is uniquely their own through song selection and the artistic interpretation of these choices. in order to do this in a satisfying way it helps to have a real live accompanist who can help you try out your tunes in a variety of tempos and keys (no, you don't have to sing in the same key as the singer on the recording). i play piano and often play with a drum machine, which provides a reasonable facsimile of an actual groove. it's great to practice with recorded accompaniments so you know how you sound without the voice of the original artist on the cd getting in the way. i have direct-to-cd recording gear so lessons and songs can be recorded and taken with you to work on at home. and if you're not quite sure what music you like, an experienced teacher can suggest material for you to try. it matters to me that you are singing songs that you really love, that bring you joy and just feel good, no matter what the style (or your skill level). i know zillions of songs and have been pretty successful in helping students find material they enjoy. \n",

      "i'm part of a group of 3 currently looking for a drummer and bassist to help get a post-hardcore band off the ground and running. we are a dual-vocalist setup with a female singer as well as a screamer/backup singer. a lot of our songs are designed around having 1 guitarist, of which our guitarist is very well adapted, and sometime a 2nd guitar will be added by myself or our singer. stylistically we aim to be pretty middle-ground within the hardcore genre, having a range of songs from melodic and emotional to fast and heavy. we're influenced by a wide variety of bands within the punk/hardcore scene, some popular ones being a day to remember, bring me the horizon, paramore, dance gavin dance, emery, silverstein, alesana, underoath, brand new, august burns red, asking alexandria, pierce the veil, taking back sunday, the devil wears prada, oh sleeper, issues, etc.....\n",

      "we're serious about investing our time into this band and taking it as far as we can go, so naturally are looking for decent musicians who can play their instruments well. just as important though are the following 2 things. the first is that you can be consistent with communicating through text, for things like scheduling and discussing song ideas outside of practice. and the second is that you have the discipline to practice songs and come up with parts in your own time. these are things that our last bassist and drummer had difficulty with, so i just want to bring them up from the get go. \n",
      "\n",
      "as a whole though we want to grow as a team and family that can have fun as well as get some quality music written. we're all in our early 20's and understand it's important to make sure we're all enjoying ourselves and vibing with each other while trying to get legit work done. that being said though, in order to make this work we really need people who are willing to dedicate time long term to a project that may not ever have any financial return. our biggest goal is to work towards recording, playing shows, and maybe even touring someday, simply for the love of the music and making some good friends. \n",

(i promise this is not a scam, and i promise i definitely know how to sing! i'm not posting this thinking i can sing, but actually can't hold a pitch. i can definitely sing and can hold the right pitches very well! haha!) i know i didn't post to much info, but honestly its because i know this website can be sketchy sometimes haha. so, if you are interested, please contact me personally with the info below and i will gladly share a link to my singing videos so you can hear what i sound like, and learn more about me! :) and i would love to hear you guys as well! hope to hear back from some peeps! \n",

      "\n",
      "the jams have been going strong for several years and we have a good core group of regular players. i am now looking for additional players to add to the mix whenever i have space open. we are usually doing the jams on tuesday evenings, 7-10pm, about once every 3-4 weeks. right now i have a space open for a drummer with a light touch--someone who's interested in the challenge of adding percussion to a set played in a small room, without microphones for the singers. it's an acoustic jam in principle, so we keep the levels pretty low. it's definitely not full-on rock drumming.\n",
      "\n",
      "that said, we have a yamaha electronic drum set in the jam space, and it's a very solid kit for these purposes. beyond the electronic kit, you could also do acoustic snare and brush, cajon, or hand percussion.\n",

      "\n",
      "i am an experienced guitar player/singer/multi-instrumentalist who organizes a regular jam and is looking for other fun, laid-back players to join in. i've played for a long time and have an extensive repertoire of classic rock/folk/blues/pop standards, but i'm certainly no pro. i just love the music. this jam is perfect for amateurs who have some solid musical chops but don't get a chance to play much in a group context, or for more serious musicians who just want to hang out and play some tunes in a chill, non-professional setting. hopefully the description below will give you pretty good idea of what the jam is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "while the jam is relaxed, it is also very well organized, with method to the madness that keeps the tunes coming. i come out of a hootenanny performance tradition and my songbook leans toward classic rock: the band, neil young, bob dylan, rolling stones, grateful dead. we also do some country / alt country (like gillian welch, emmylou harris, ryan adams, and lucinda williams tunes), plus blues and folk (such as old crow medicine show and rise up singing standards). i take suggestions for jam tunes ahead of time and give people a chance to learn the songs in advance if they want. at the same time, i always have chord charts and lyrics on hand for everything, so you don't need to know the numbers by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "the jam takes place about once every 3-4 weeks in the home of one of our players, usually with 8-10 musicians. it's an acoustic jam in principle, but we amp the bass and various lead instrumental parts as necessary. it's all about getting together with like-minded people to sing songs, share some riffs, create a few harmonies, and have fun. i pass the hat at the sessions to pay for jam-related expenses. contributions are purely voluntary and some people also contribute by bringing beers or a snack. it's a share and share alike situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm currently looking for a percussionist to join the fun. in theory this is an acoustic jam (we don't use microphones for the singers, and we try to keep the volume low enough so that we don't overpower them), and we're set up in a pretty small room. we're looking for a drummer that can be creative in keeping the beat and adding to the ensemble within those confines--someone with a light touch. we have a yamaha electronic drum set in the jam space, and it's a very solid kit for these purposes. beyond the electronic kit, you could also do acoustic snare and brush, cajon, or hand percussion. let me know what you have in mind and we can discuss the options.\n",
      "\n",
      "besides musicianship, i'm generally looking for people who are very reliable and who might want to commit to doing something like this at least once a month. i want people who reply promptly to e-mails and show up when they say they will. the jam is usually on tuesday night, but very rarely on a wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you think you fit the bill, please send me an e-mail. i'm open to many styles. just let me know a bit about your musical background, what you like to play, and who you are. i'll look forward to hearing from you! \n",

      " ...........................................the musical instruments for sale section on the local has to be the funniest cl area i have ever seen (emphasis on the word \"local\", in nyc and nashville the cl for sale sections are a lot more realistic [yes, there are overpriced exceptions]). the majority of items for sale here are listed for prices that are greater than the product would cost new. i realize that amateur and weekend warrior musicians typically overpay because they do not understand the basics of buying gear and instruments, but you would think they could at least read well enough to find the real market value. no, do not look on ebay, which has become so inflated since everyone owns a computer. look in the real world.  \n",
      "\n",
      " ......................................................even if you do look at ebay or reverb prices that include a large markup over what the seller actually receives to cover the ebay and paypal fees, you need to look in the \"advanced search\" section to see what the item is actually selling for on a regular basis. a lot of people put up items on ebay for months at a time with ridiculous prices trolling for suckers or living in a fantasy about what their gear is worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "........................................another strange thing about ebay is that most bidders do not know that the only bid that ever matters is the final bid. people that use automatic bidding or repeatedly bid are just bidding against themselves and raising the price. the last bid wins, not the most frequent, and nothing before that matters. ebay loves people who are foolish enough to use automatic bidding or repeatedly bid. they get more commission on the inflated price. nothing like preying upon people who do not understand auctions.\n",

      ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, people who use the words \"vintage\" or \"rare\" for cheap or heavily mass produced items. do you really know how many pieces of these products were manufactured if they are supposedly \"rare\"? vintage in the musical instrument world means before 1970.\n",
      "\n",
      "+++++++++++++++++++ then, of course, those people who don't know that instruments manufactured in the 1970s are the poorest quality in history. the only goal in the 70s was mass production as quickly as possible to meet the huge demand when everyone thought they would be rock stars. quality was not a factor. there is a lot of reading materials on this subject if you weren't there for it. older isn't always better.\n",
      "\n",
      "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++additionally, there are the people trying to sell classical guitars like a used jose ramirez 1a for more than $3000. in their heyday in the late sixties these were still only acceptable classical guitars. try a kohno, stephen connor, or hauser (good luck). or, if you want a ramirez buy an r4 for a thousand dollars less.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========================moreover, people trying to sell used gibson es-175 guitars for more than $2200. these are only popular because they were cheap enough for poor jazz players to afford, not because the have any value. try an l-5 ces (wes montgomery or standard l5) if you want a gibson. or, if you want something a little more pro user friendly buy something like a sadowsky or an gibson  l-4ces. if you want something in between try a guild artist award.\n",

      "\n",
      "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++there are people who are just too lazy to figure out the correct price, which isn't always market contingent. with the internet the local concept is somewhat irrelevant. again, same people who probably don't know that a 40% discount off the mfgr's \"list\" price is the standard for non-pros and has been since the 1960s and for pros with real product on major labels, if you have to pay for something you pay a maximum of 5% over the retailer's cost. although there are some items at \"fair trade\" prices such as eventide products, they are still sold below the list price if you aren't afraid to ask. i don't understand why people would overpay online at musicians friend, sweetwater, z sounds...moreover, i never understood why people think the tag price at sam ash or guitar center is really what they expect you to pay. a perfect analogy is someone who would be stupid enough to pay the sticker price on a new car. that is unless you are in example of what circus pt barnum repeatedly said after hearing the expression from david hannum : \"there is a sucker born every minute.\" he was a very wise man.\n",

      "if your interest in playing guitar is to be able to write songs, then i'm the teacher for you. \n",
      "most approaches to teaching guitar are limited to having students learn to play popular songs they have already heard. very few teachers can teach you how to come up with your own material. this is my specialty. \n",
      "in the course of instructing you i will most defintely teach you how to play the cover songs you'd like to play. i feel that learning to play other peoples music is very important. but as an added benefit in my program i will explain how the writers of those songs came up with their musical ideas so you can learn how to do it yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "the type of student this program will benefit the most: your interest is in being creative. you have something you want say and you'd like to express that in words and music. you want to be an original artist with your own distinct style. you hear songs you love and have a gnawing interest in how it all comes together. you'd like to perform your songs for others. am i talking to you? \n",
      "study with me and you will learn: \n",
      "basic chords and as you advance more complex chord structures. how to play scales and the different types of scales there are so you can learn to solo. \n",
      "music theory, which is essential in learning to take your musical ideas to the next level. \n",
      "in addition i will teach you how to keep a lyric journal. ideas for songs can come at any time and you must have pen and paper ready. \n",
      "also, i will show you how to care for your guitar, how to string it, how to buy one that's right for you, how to get gigs when your ready etc. \n",

      "some particulars: i will travel to most locals in the bostonmetro area. my fee is a very reasonable $35  per lesson. (45 min.)  i suggest students purchase a chord book and a guitar tuner before the first lesson. open to any age and any level of playing ability.\n",
      "my backround: i attended berklee college of music as an instrumental perfomance major. i have been writing, performing and teaching music for over 30+ years. i have composed over 200 songs in my career, some of which have received radio airplay. i am currently in a working band that plays original music in which i wrote all the songs. i'm a very easy going person and i understand the patience required in working with new students. my basic intention is to share the gift of music with others which has opened many doors for me and has enhanced my life in countless untold ways. i look forward to hearing from you. tom \n",

      "we practice at my house in caldwell. i've got a complete drum set (right handed setup), pa system, our amps, all that good stuff. the money we make at shows gets split evenly between the members but aside from that it's more of a passion project at the moment than a job (though we'd like to change that sooner than later). the objective is to keep the general vibe of the songs the same when played live as they are in the recordings while also putting a bit of a different spin on them. since the drum parts are written out for the recordings that means that wherever there's room for creativity you're free to deviate from the recordings to varying degrees (which is a decent amount of the set, we can go over all that) though a handful of parts will need to follow the recordings more closely. \n",

      "my name is michael and i'm a creative/dedicated acoustic guitar player-and-singer of over 65 beatles songs (see attached list). i've specialized in playing this great pop music, alone and exclusively, and so i find i need a confident, support-acoustic guitarist to fill out the sound & who can also sing the higher parts (very often some lead vocal passages), in harmony (not falsetto), to accompany what i do on vocals. by the way: paul's go-to note for high parts is high a. can you hit that? \n",
      "\n",
      "actually, depending on the song, i'd do the lead part and you'd do an atmospheric, lead melody-double vocal. other times, you'd sing the higher, lead-part while i do a made-up lower harmony. i'm a good singer, but i can't sing like paul mccartney.  \n",
      "on other songs, you'd sing the 'ahhh/lyric' backups, or whatever could be done to emulate the recordings & maximize the vocals with understated, close harmonies.\n",

      "\n",
      "i've played with various musicians and i find women are better to collaborate with, as well as having naturally higher ranges (any guy who can sing like paul should have his own project) :^). being already-familiar with the songs, and a musical fan of all their material would be needed, as it would speed communication and results. \n",
